# Learning ML foundations with Python
This is a repository I use for Learning Machine Learning Foundations wtih Python from LinkedIn Learning [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=70208586&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fmachine-learning-with-python-foundations%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DKxrG2tARRbWIyn4ggT8dZA%253D%253D).

## Course description 
You’ve probably heard about machine learning before, but have you ever wondered what that term really means? How does a machine learn? Have you thought about building a machine learning model, but didn’t know where to start?
In this course, Frederick Nwanganga introduces machine learning in an approachable way and provides step-by-step guidance on how to get started with machine learning via the most in-demand language in use today, Python. Frederick starts with exactly what it means for machines to learn and the different ways they learn, then gets into how to collect, understand, and prepare data for machine learning. He also provides guided examples of how to accomplish each step using Python. Finally, he brings it all together to build, evaluate, and interpret the results of a machine learning model in Python.
